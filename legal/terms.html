        AND CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND/OR ANY AIRTAP SERVICES. YOU ASSUME TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND ANY LINKED SITES. YOUR SOLE REMEDY AGAINST AIRTAP FOR DISSATISFACTION
        WITH THE SITE OR ANY CONTENT IS TO STOP USING THE SITE OR ANY SUCH CONTENT. THIS LIMITATION OF RELIEF IS A PART OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. The above disclaimer applies to any damages, liability or injuries caused by any failure of performance,
        error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or destruction of or unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use, whether for breach of contract, tort, negligence

    <h2 class="title">Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p class="text">Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Airtap be liable to you for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental or punitive damages, including lost profits, even if Airtap has been advised of the possibility of such damages. If, notwithstanding
        the other provisions of these Terms of Use, Airtap is found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Site or any Content, Airtap’s liability shall in no event exceed the greater
        of US$5.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Indemnity</h2>
    <p class="text">You agree to indemnify and hold Airtap, its officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’
        fees), made against Airtap by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Violation of These Terms of Use</h2>
    <p class="text">Airtap may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Site, or to identify, contact or bring legal
        action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Airtap’s rights or property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the Site, including Airtap’s customers. Airtap
        reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that Airtap deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Airtap also may disclose your information when Airtap determines that
        applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes. You acknowledge and agree that Airtap may preserve any transmittal or communication by you
        with Airtap through the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, and may also disclose such data if required to do so by law or Airtap determines that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with legal
        process, (2) enforce these Terms of Use, (3) respond to claims that any such data violates the rights of others, or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Airtap, its employees, users of or visitors to the Site, and the public.
        You agree that Airtap may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Site and/or block your future access to the Site if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Use or other agreements or guidelines
        which may be associated with your use of the Site. You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Airtap, for which monetary damages would
        be inadequate, and you consent to Airtap obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that Airtap deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Airtap may have at law or in equity. You
        agree that Airtap may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Site, for cause, which includes (but is not limited to) (1) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a request by you (self-initiated
        account deletions), (3) discontinuance or material modification of the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, or (4) unexpected technical issues or problems. If Airtap does take any legal action against you as a result of your violation
        of these Terms of Use, Airtap will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to Airtap. You agree that Airtap will not be liable to you
        or to any third party for termination of your access to the Site as a result of any violation of these Terms of Use.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p class="text">If any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision
        that best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, so that these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Airtap with regard to your use of the Site, and any and all
        other written or oral agreements or understandings previously existing between you and Airtap with respect to such use are hereby superseded and cancelled. Other than as provided in a purchase agreement you enter into with Airtap, Airtap will
        not accept any counter-offers to these Terms of Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected. Airtap’s failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver by Airtap of any provision
        or any right it has to enforce these Terms of Use, nor shall any course of conduct between Airtap and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use shall not be interpreted or construed to confer
        any rights or remedies on any third parties. Airtap provides access to Airtap international data and, therefore, may contain references or cross references to Airtap products, programs and services that are not announced in your country. Such
        reference does not imply that Airtap in your country intends to announce such products, programs or services.</p>
