    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2 class="title">Legal Framework</h2>
    <p class="text">The Airtap Privacy Policy was updated on June 25th, 2021.</p>
    <p class="text">In the following policy, Airtap refers to the service offered by Airtap Ltd. (the "Company" or "We") through the joinairtap.com and airtap.dev websites (the "Service "). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect through your access
        and use of our Service, the use we make of such information; and the security level we provide for protecting such information. By visiting our websites and using the Services provided here, you consent to the terms outlined in this privacy policy.</p>
    <p class="text">The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and all data storage infrastructure is located solely within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the “UK”), the European Union (the "EU "), and the United States of America (the
        “USA”), and thus governed by the laws and regulations of the UK, the EU, and the USA.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Data Collection</h2>
    <p class="text">In most cases, we don’t need your personal information to provide our services. However, you may disclose your email address, first & last names to Airtap. This information is used for security purposes, customer support and notifications. Visiting
        our website: We use specific analytics software (Google Analytics, Matomo & etc.) provided by third-parties only on Airtap’s main website (joinairtap.com) to collect some information (device type, language and etc.) in order to improve our services.
        Other our websites and apps have no analytics software at all to ensure users’ privacy. Airtap voice dataplane: our dataplane nodes do not collect any traffic sent by your devices. We do not collect IP addresses, device information & etc. Any
        data is deleted automatically within 30 minutes after the end of the voice session. IP Logging: By default, Airtap does not keep permanent IP logs. We also don 't record your login IP address unless this feature is specifically enabled by the
        user. However, IP logs are sometimes kept to combat abuse and fraud, and your IP address may be retained if you are engaged in activities that breach our terms and conditions (DDoS attacks against Airtap’s infrastructure, brute force attacks,
        etc). Payment Information: The Company relies on third parties to process credit card, PayPal, and Bitcoin transactions so the Company necessarily must share payment information with third parties. Anonymous Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
        payments are accepted, however. Native Applications: When you use our native applications, we (or the mobile app platform providers) may collect certain information in addition to the information mentioned elsewhere in this Policy. We may use
        mobile error analytics software to send crash information to our developers so that we can fix bugs quickly. Some operating systems may also collect and aggregate anonymous statistics if you opt in. Therefore, such data may be governed by the
        privacy policy and terms and conditions of such software vendors. None of the software on our apps will ever access or track any location-based information from your device at any time.</p>

    <h2 class=" title ">Data Use</h2>
    <p class="text">We do not have any advertising on our websites & applications. Any data that we do have will never be shared except under the circumstances described below in the Data Disclosure Section. We do NOT do any analysis on the limited data we do possess.
    </p>

    <h2 class="title ">Data Storage</h2>
    <p class="text">All servers used in connection with the provisioning of the Service are located in the UK, the EU, and the USA. Only Airtap employees have access to the servers. Data is ALWAYS transferred in encrypted format to our servers. All application specific
        data (e.g. Airtap voice dataplane traffic) is ALWAYS encrypted and we do not possess the ability to access any user encrypted data on the production servers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="title ">Right to Access, Rectification, Erasure and Portability</h2>
    <p class="text">Through the Service, you can directly access, edit, delete or export personal data (according to the EU General Data Protection Regulation) processed by the Company in your use of the Service. To access, edit, delete, or export personal data, contact
        hello@joinairtap.com If your account has been suspended for a breach of our terms and conditions, and you would like to exercise the rights related to your personal data, you can make a request to our support via email hello@joinairtap.com.
    </p>

    <h2 class="title ">Data Retention</h2>
    <p class="text">When an Airtap account is closed, data is immediately deleted from production servers. Active accounts will have data retained indefinitely.</p>

    <h2 class="title ">Data Disclosure</h2>
    <p class="text">Usually, we do not disclose your account information to third-party companies & government authorities. We will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we receive notice from the Interpol or the UK security services regarding a court order
        that is coming from the two authorities we are legally obligated to recognize: the Royal Courts of Justice or the European Court of Justice. We do not provide any information unless we have received an original copy of the court order by registered
        post or in person. Your email address will be disclosed to our partner company in order to deliver messages concerning your account and our products. If a request is made for user’s application-specific encrypted data that Airtap does not possess
        the ability to decrypt, the fully encrypted data may be turned over. However, Airtap uses advanced encryption algorithms & encrypted data that cannot necessarily be decrypted by government authorities and other third parties. If permitted by law,
        Airtap will always contact a user first before any data disclosure. Airtap may contest court orders. In such situations, the Company will not comply with the court order until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted. Therefore, not all
        court orders will lead to data disclosure.</p>

    <h2 class="title ">Modifications to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p class="text">Airtap reserves the right to periodically review and change this policy from time to time and we will notify users who have enabled the notification preference about changes to our Privacy Policy. Continued use of the Service will be deemed as acceptance
        of such changes.</p>

    <h2 class="title ">Applicable Law</h2>
    <p class="text">This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the substantive laws of the UK. Any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to the Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the competent UK court being expressly reserved.</p>

    <h2 class="title ">Warrant</h2>
    <p class="text">Canary Airtap has not produced any information in response to a secret subpoena and has not built "backdoors " for any government into our products. All government requests for user data need to come through the front door (i.e., by serving a valid
        legal process upon Airtap).</p>

    <h2 class="title ">Contact information</h2>
    <p class="text">If you have any questions or concerns about the matters discussed in this privacy policy, please contact us hello@joinairtap.com.</p>
